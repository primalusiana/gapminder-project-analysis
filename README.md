# Gapminder Project Analysis

# Introduction
Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators In this project, I will choose 5 indicators to investigate
- Agricultural land coverage = Refers to the share of land area that is arable, under permanent crops, and under permanent pastures (scala from 0-1, should be multiplied by 100% to convert to percentage)
- Flood affected = Total number of people getting affected, injured, or killed in flood during given year (number of people)
- Forest coverage = Percentage of total land area that has been covered with forest during the given year, excluding other wood land which is spanning more than 0.5 hectares, with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of 5-10 percent (scala: from 0-1, should be multiplied by 100% to convert to percentage)
- Energy production = Refers to forms of primary energy (number of products)
- Total income = Gross domestic product per person, inflation adjusted. (in PPP)

# Research Questions
Using the data, there are several questions to be explored and answered
- Which regions have the lowest and highest performance of each indicator?
- Have certain regions of the world been growing in each of the indicators?
- Is there any correlation between selected indicators?
